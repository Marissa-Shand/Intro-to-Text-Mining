# Text Mining Motivation



# Working with text data

"A **token** is a meaningful unit of text, such as wa word, that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting test into tokens" [1]. Can be a word, n-gram, sentence or paragraph.

## Packages we will be using 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(gutenbergr)
```

## Exploring Project Gutenberg

"Project Gutenberg is an online library of free eBooks. Project Gutenberg was the first provider of free electronic books, or eBooks." [2]

```{r}
## Find books by Charles Dickens
dickens <- gutenberg_works(author == 'Dickens, Charles')
dim(dickens)
head(dickens)

## We will be working with A Tale of Two Cities, which has id 98
two_cities <- gutenberg_download(98)
head(two_cities)

## There are three books that make up this book
## Get book number
two_cities <- two.cities %>% mutate(book = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^Book the"))),
                                    linenumber = row_number())

## For each book get the linenumber in the book, and the chapter
## Roman numerals: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/regular-expressions-cookbook/9780596802837/ch06s09.html
two_cities <- two_cities %>% group_by(book) %>% 
   mutate(book_linenumber = row_number(),
          chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^(?=[MDCLXVI])M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{0,3})[.]")))) %>%
   ungroup()

## Convert to tidy text
tidy_two_cities <- two_cities %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)
head(tidy_two_cities)
```
## Stop words

```{r}
## Error arose: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9221310/r-debugging-only-0s-may-be-mixed-with-negative-subscripts
data(stop_words)
stop_words

tidy_two_cities %>% anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word" = "word"))
```


# Sentiment Analysis

## Sentiment Lexicons 

tidytext provides three general purpose lexicons:

1. AFINN

2. Bing

3. NRC


# Relationships between words: n-grams and correlations

# sample change

# Latent Direchlet Allocation
